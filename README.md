# SSCP Project 5: Computational prediction of cardiac electropharmacology - how much does the model matter?
Compare features of cardiomyocyte action potential computational models between animals and model lineages.

June 3, 2021

## 1. Project Summary
Computational tools are increasingly seen as a key bridge for making the inferential jumps between
electrophysiologic data collected among the major cardiac cell types used in drug screening (i.e.
rodent, rabbit, canine, and human stem cell-derived cardiac myocytes). Because models of these
cell types contain the basic properties of each cell type (and differences between them), both linear
and non-linear methods have been developed to translate among them, and importantly, from them
to adult human cardiac cells. In this way, one holy grail of computational cardiac pharmacology
is to leverage these models to reliably predict clinical outcomes of drugs based on data collected
in other species, or human cell lines.
One major challenge with these developments is to understand how important the underlying
model formulations are to the accuracy and reliability of prediction. In this project we will use at
least two distinct lineages of models (new models in this field are generally developed from prior
models) to understand how differences between those lineages impact the predictive capabilities
of each. In the end this will allow us to quantitatively describe whether more energy should be
directed towards identifying and correcting weaknesses in the model formulations, or instead, if
that energy should be focused on improving the methods for high-volume analytics that capture
trends which are reliable for prediction, even if they are not strictly physiologically accurate.
## 2. Main Objectives
Students will gain:
• A working understanding of cardiac ventricular myocyte ionic models from various species,
and the key differences between them.
• A working understanding of two distinct model lineages built to capture these species differences.
• A working understanding of approaches and formalisms used to translate among the different
models within and between lineages.
## 3. Tasks
Developing a systematic approach to quantifying prediction errors due to formulation-specific aspects
in each model lineage, versus those that are inherent to any model that is fit to cardiac
electrophysiologic data.
